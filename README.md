# Image Spectra Notebook

This notebook demonstrates using [numpy.fft](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/routines.fft.html) to compute and visualize image spectra for [CS6475 - Computational Photography](https://compphotography.wordpress.com/) at Georgia Tech. There is an accompanying [talk](https://youtu.be/zxzO2XmZJLw) on YouTube discussing the code.

## Setup

The notebook requires Jupyter (see [docs](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for installation), with openCV (pre-3.0 recommended, >=2.4.10), and matplotlib. The easiest way to setup is by installing anaconda (which includes Jupyter and the conda package manager).

## Execution

Run `jupyter notebook` from the root directory of this git repo, then select the notebook file from your web browser.
